# Code samples from Ansible: Up and Running, 3rd Edition

Published in 2022...reading at the beginning of 2025.

From O'Reilly (with work login): <https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ansible-up-and/9781098109141/>

Code for book: <https://github.com/ansiblebook>

A lot of this will be Vagrant files to spin up test machines.

## Setup

Had trouble using WSL to launch vagrant. It worked, until it didn't, and now I can't get it to work again...

Going to use multiple VirtualBox VMs, with one as the controller.

`vagrant init ubuntu/focal64` to stick with the book...
